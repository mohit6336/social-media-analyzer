Social Media Analyzer is a lightweight web tool built to evaluate and improve social post content by extracting and summarizing text from PDFs and images. The backend uses Tesseract OCR combined with Poppler to convert uploaded PDFs into images and extract readable text. Extracted text is processed locally using NLTK: sentence tokenization, stopword removal, frequency-based scoring to produce a short extractive summary, and simple keyword extraction converted to social-ready hashtags. A minimal tone detector classifies content as Positive, Negative, or Neutral using a small curated lexicon.

User flows include secure JWT-based registration and login, protected analysis endpoints, and per-user history stored in JSON for the demo. The frontend is a modern dark-mode React app using Tailwind and react-dropzone for drag-and-drop uploads. Users can view extracted text, a summary, suggested hashtags, and download a PDF report. The architecture avoids paid AI services — everything runs locally (or in a Docker container for deployment). This design choice ensures the project can be demonstrated and tested offline while remaining extendable: swapping the summarizer for an LLM or adding cloud OCR/APIs only requires small integration points. The focus is speed of iteration, clear UX, and a tight demo-ready feature set suitable for interview evaluation.
